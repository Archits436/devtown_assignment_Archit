I have developed this product list website which shows products of different categories. The users can also filter and sort the products and navigate through different pages of products.
I have also provided the running project link - https://archit-devtown-assignment.netlify.app/

In this project, I have created 5 components :
i. Filter.jsx - To filter the products by category
ii. Pagination.jsx - To provide a neat and clean user experience to users for navigation
iii. Sorting.jsx - To sort the Products in any order of their price
iv. ProductItem.jsx - To display one product card which would contain the details
v. ProductList.jsx - To display the whole list of products

I have also used styled components in this website.

#RUNNING THE PROJECT

Download the source code into your local environment.
Run the command "npm install" in the terminal.
To run the project on the live server, run the command "npm start".
To add more products in the app, add the code for more products in the products.js file in the utilities folder inside the src folder.
